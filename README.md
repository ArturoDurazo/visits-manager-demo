# Visits Manager App
A small project to get started with vue.js and try out new things. I also uploaded it to Azure as a Static Web app and AWS amplify as practice:
```
Azure
https://purple-plant-0dceea70f.azurestaticapps.net

AWS Amplify
https://main.d3d8wospz5ast7.amplifyapp.com/
```
The app consists of a listing of people who will visit you. You can set up their names, the date, add and delete the visit and toggle the reminder by clicking the visit. It features web storage so it will be saved locally to your browser.

To run it locally just run
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
